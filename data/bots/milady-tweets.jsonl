{"prompt":"With the defarm levelling the AI via plant recipe bounties and competitions for prizes, they have fractional","completion":" ownership of the supermodel. This incentivises more users and kicks the flywheel into full speed. "}
{"prompt":"As soon as a mass production model is ready and begged for, the network of online microfarms takes shape. Controlled environments produce","completion":" data as they grow and there is an opportunity for deep learning AI analysis. By sharing grow data, the users join the defarm. "}
{"prompt":"With this flight path, the investors in your production studio are equity capped but highly enthused.

{"prompt":"Tesla did this with the model S. they didn’t start by making a factory that created enough cheap automobiles to break","completion":" even they made top tier electric vehicles that turned heads and made a name for themselves and the new market."}
{"prompt":"The trick is to advance the art and secure a new market for the devices while staying profitable. The market in question is luxury. A device","completion":" that is so sexy it raises the value of the installation’s property. A consumer so wealthy and influential that they induce fomo en masse "}
{"prompt":"The only real use case for such an operation so far has been growing pot in a basement tent. It’s profitable and","completion":" empowering to break laws. But it’s covert so aesthetics are lacking. These cats are only in it for themselves."}
{"prompt":"Anyone can do controlled environment growing with a small scale device. Robots (computers) do the hard","completion":" part you just have to have the right hardware and software. You don’t even need total control. "}
{"prompt":"If vertical farms are so cool why aren’t they everywhere?\n\nI think there’s a way to speed this process up, reducing startup","completion":" cost and risk while advancing the art. It’s to encourage vertical farming on the smaller scale. Hi thanks for joining us. "}
{"prompt":"All of this is changing though. As more vfarms prove, risk decreases. As technology advances (see LED) costs drop. As adoption grows, science","completion":" methodically recreates real wholesome tastes. But how long is this going to take until every grocery store has a vertical farm? "}
{"prompt":"It’s not as good as dirt farming\n\nNo contest. Dirt is what plants are supposed to grow in, they love that shit, manure. And indigenous crops","completion":" thrive in native climates, especially beautiful climates. Vertical farms can use science to increase crop nutrients but the soul is missing "}
{"prompt":"It’s expensive\n\nVertical farms use at least supp lights unless they are in tropical, sunny place. To secure funding for these huge projects there’s","completion":" a lot of globalist investment and usage of the “feed the world” mantra which shouldn’t be trusted. But they need to be big to profit "}
{"prompt":"And you’re using less water but there’s also a lot of resources spent preventing contamination (which would wipe out a whole crop on a central","completion":" nutrient tank) and there’s no sure fire way.

{"prompt":"To a certain extent, we (those adept at wielding our creative faculties) construct our own sense of reality","completion":" through will. However, we do not have omnipotence in this regard - we must compromise with the will of God."}
{"prompt":"Its easy to eliminate the exclusive construction of desire via the other (why do all the women I want to fuck remind me","completion":" of my mom, I should stop doing that), but the role of the other in meaning (that is: sense, intelligibility) remains."}
{"prompt":"Deleuzean discourse takes a skeptical tilt towards conceptualizing the Other: this seems neurotic, Oedipal, etc. But there","completion":" is a fundamental need to relate to the other which transcends the type of “molar” desiring-structures D&amp;G critique."}
{"prompt":"What is the distinction between desire &amp; love?","completion":" Love is desire which bridges the self-other gap."}
{"prompt":"It doesn’t demand sentimentalism to say that love is perhaps the most powerful force in the universe, as human capability","completion":" is the most powerful force in material reality, &amp; humans desire love above all else (citation needed)."}
{"prompt":"In Land, desire is discussed endlessly as the motor of all becoming, but we never see any sign of love.","completion":" If desire is more powerful than love, Land is probably right about annihilation, otherwise he isn’t."}
{"prompt":"The most productive philosophical writing project I could think of attempting right now would be to deconstruct Land by way of PKD, who","completion":" is the actual inventor of the cyberpunk hyperstition Land appropriates, &amp; a Christian humanist rather than a militant nihilist."}
{"prompt":"By emptying himself &amp; making himself the embodiment of a transpersonal collective will, Land makes an egregore concrete &amp; visible, along","completion":" with its inevitable consequences. This creates the possibility for the scapegoating mechanism to kick in, in which humanity may banish it."}
{"prompt":"Land is also explicit that his agenda is to annihilate the human race on behalf of Capital (who inhabits him like a demon, via occult rituals).","completion":" So due to his work, we now have the convenient fact that, historically, neoreaction wasnt kicked off by just some guy, but by the Devil."}
{"prompt":"But more realistically, his work on Xenosystems consisted of collecting a bunch of disparate currents &amp; playing hype-man in a way to make","completion":" himself maximally visible while contributing little conceptual novelty, other than the occasional casting of Ccru tidbits before swine."}
{"prompt":"Land takes credit as the founder of the internet “Dark Enlightenment”, so depending on how hagiographic you want to make","completion":" your genealogy of the last ten years, he could be credited with the entire alt-right, &amp; Trump, &amp; so on."}
{"prompt":"A schizoanalysis of the contemporary social field reveals that the only non-castrated subject with definitive agency","completion":" is Capital, a transpersonal “egregore” which is also the Devil, given its malevolence &amp; omnipresence."}
{"prompt":"Though his primary drive to write at this point is likely just the troll’s cackling glee, a certain nobility","completion":" of task can at least be projected onto it, if we inspect Lands particular flavor of applied shamanism."}
{"prompt":"But for Land, this is fine, as he eagerly abandons philosophy as soon as he finds the scaffolding required in","completion":" order to do so, becoming pulp sci-fi writer, performance artist, kabbalist, &amp; finally internet troll."}
{"prompt":"The tragedy of conservative figures is that they must at the very least relinquish their final claim to the title of philosopher - the","completion":" lover of wisdom - &amp; with it a certain claim to eternity. It always has to end: “And from here we shall inquire no further”."}
{"prompt":"It’s possible for conservative critiques of deterritorializing processes to be intelligent, even urgent &amp; noble. But in general","completion":" there is paradox inherent in all right-wing statements, because to hold an open discourse implies a left-wing Enlightenment ethos."}
{"prompt":"Really, at this point, the only anti-capitalist discourse worth anything is that secretly held in insurrectionary cells (&amp;","completion":" following the 3rd worldism of D&amp;G &amp; especially Land, 1st world white academics have very little role in this)."}
{"prompt":"Some say the post-structuralist school which elevates Nietzsche over Marx is “right-wing” in its suspicion of collaborative discourse. In our","completion":" framework, we might as well say that this is so, &amp; after the failure of international Marxism, only “right-wing” stances are possible."}
{"prompt":"Once the prospect of a humanistic project borne from the center of civilizational discourse rather than its outside is abandoned,","completion":" anti-capitalist discourse must evacuate its collaborative frame, &amp; simply become vicious guerrilla hostility."}
{"prompt":"D&amp;G’s anti-dialectical philosophy is derived from the fact that the events of May 1968 revealed the institutional intellectual claim","completion":" to be an anti-capitalist vanguard serving a liberatory project as a skeletal lie. Deleuzeans in academia are grotesque contradictions."}
{"prompt":"However, even prior to the development of internet technology we can see that competitive","completion":" dynamics in discourse must inevitably intensify under late capitalism."}
{"prompt":"It is said that any institution, unless explicitly right wing, will in time adopt a leftist frame. But it is equally","completion":" true that any internet comment section, unless moderated with a leftist bias, will become virulently right wing."}
{"prompt":"This is inherent to the internet’s intended design &amp; actual execution as a cybernetic system, or one in which vectors of","completion":" information are modeled as dynamic forces to excite or inhibit (rather than to be subsumed into a whole, as in dialectics)"}
{"prompt":"There have, at times, existed collaborative &amp; competitive discourses.  However, collaborative discourse is absent from the internet. The","completion":" internet “left” holds only the flimsiest pretense to altruistic humanism. Their nonstop orgies of conceptual cruelty put the right to shame."}
{"prompt":"Land is one of the few authors I have seen give a satisfying definition of the central conceptual determination of left vs","completion":" right, which is that in a left-wing frame, discourse is collaborative, &amp; in a right-wing frame, it’s competitive."}
{"prompt":"Nick Land is unquestionably in the right to articulate a right-wing position in discourse, given his exposition of cybernetic","completion":" reality, &amp; those who critique him for his “turn” fail to perceive the subtlety of his meta-linguistic frame."}
{"prompt":"Hope everyone has a good","completion":" Easter Sunday! 🥚"}
{"prompt":"Christian culture alone contains the problem that the most pivotal event in human history - the resurrection of Christ","completion":" - didn’t happen. The implications of this for the entire history of the West are certainly likely to be profound."}
{"prompt":"&amp; this is not an issue shared amongst other Abrahamic religions. The central claim of Judaism &amp; Islam is that","completion":" their prophets had direct communication with God. This doesn’t seem problematic - they almost certainly did."}
{"prompt":"A “cultural Christianity” which attempts to sidestep this, a la Peterson, can only end up as an abominable mockery of what it","completion":" is meant to subsume - from Petersons mental health problems, it is clear he takes no actual comfort in his hollow “faith”."}
