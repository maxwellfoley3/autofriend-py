{"prompt":"", "completion":" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (Touch not; taste not; handle not;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye are our glory and joy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore comfort one another with these words."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Rejoice evermore."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Pray without ceasing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Quench not the Spirit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Despise not prophesyings."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Abstain from all appearance of evil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Brethren, pray for us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Adam was first formed, then Eve."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These things command and teach."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Honour widows that are widows indeed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For some are already turned aside after Satan."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But godliness with contentment is great gain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And having food and raiment let us be therewith content."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this will we do, if God permit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And having an high priest over the house of God;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For by it the elders obtained a good report."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For our God is a consuming fire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let brotherly love continue."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grace be with you all. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Do not err, my beloved brethren."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Use hospitality one to another without grudging."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We love him, because he first loved us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is the first time that it has been brought together in a book."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Ccru website has flickered in and out of existence over the last decade (or more), withoutanybody in the old Ccru circle fully  or even tentatively  grasping how this facility has beensustained, or accepting responsibility for its preservation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It now appears to have disappearedpermanently."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This terminal submergence of the principal Ccru archival deposit has prompted thepresent publication."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is nobody positioned to accept attribution for the work of the Ccru, nor has there ever been,so this compilation has been guided by a principal of editorial modesty."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whatever it is that occurredhere  during these years of the Numograms initial ingression into recent human history, triggeringan outbreak of digial hyperstition  is not considered a matter to be resolved in this volume, even inpart, through retrospective commentary."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Otherwise, stylisticinfelicities, factual errors, conceptual absurdities, and ethico-political monstrosities have been leftundistubed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Although original (to the Ccru site) the Ccru Glossary has been categorized as an appendix due to itsextremely general application."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The second appendix (on TV demonism) belongs outside the timeframe and micro-sociology of this collection, but was attached due to its obvious  and extreme pertinence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Tale of the EndThere was a time when Murrumur asked Katak and Oddubb a question, and although this was verylong ago it was the last question she has ever been known to ask."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was Ummnu  the last of thedemons who provoked this question, since Murrumur felt her to be always nearby, and yet neverceased to be confused by her, so that eventually she asked: How can the end be already in the middleof the beginning?So this was Murrumurs final question  and probably also her first  but it was no use at all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" NeitherOddubb nor Katak has ever noticed Ummnu  because she is half hidden in the depths of Murrumur,and half hidden deeper still so Oddubb was puzzled, and said nothing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Katak  however  found Murrumurs question extremely irritating, and replied scornfully: What nonsense! I have travelled around forever, and there was never any suggestion of an end, or of abeginning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" With those words she swirled off, as if returning to her lair, but secretly to patrol time again  whichwas also the first time  just to be sure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After that Katak was more sure than ever that she was right, or at least no less sure, and that was verysure indeed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Oddubb was so perplexed that she soon became muddled about what it was that hadperplexed her, and so forgot all about it, and probably forgot even forgetting it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So Murrumur was leftalone with her confusion, and maybe she will sort it out in the end, but then again since it hasalready been so long maybe she never will."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wethink everything interesting happens on the periphery, outside the standard modes of developedexistence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru engages with peripheral cultures not because they are down-trodden or oppressed, but becausethey include the most intense tendencies to social flatness, swarming, populating the future, andcontagious positive innovation, hatching the decisive stimuli for the systematic mutation of globalcybernetic culture."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cyber-culture has come to be synonymous with Internet-studies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru has a more fundamentalistcommitment to cybernetics, whose abstract principles of feedback dynamics, nonlinear causality, andmachinic involvement are linked to numerous issues concerning digital technology andtelecommunications, but in no way restricted to these."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru has consistently endorsed Deleuze and Guattaris insistence that machines are irreducible totechnology."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We consider cybernetics to be the practical science of excitement (amplification /inhibition of communication, mutation, and innovation)."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was important to us that they were characterized by a minimum ofacademic stuffiness, and that contemporary sonic culture (techno and jungle) were as thoroughlymixed into proceedings as possible."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru particularly encouraged polymedia presentations, involvingspoken text, audio, and video or other visuals."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Our assumption throughout was that philosophy/social theory could be exciting and that the deadeningof all visceral response to intellectual exchange was a semi-deliberate strategy serving oppressivesocial interests."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" The so-called new-economy  indexed by the nova-bubble mania of the American stock-market  is no different in itsdiagrammatic abstraction to the hyperstitious practices of the Plateau of Leng, relics of lost Lemuria,from which the Bon sorcerors of ancient Tibet assembled their dread cult."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Dont believe it for a second."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" This should make you very scared indeed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My tale is easier to tell because of the brave and honest trailblazing done by Cathy OBrien."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It isCathy who has done most to expose the monstrous evil of the Monarch program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Every American  infact every concerned citizen of the world  needs to read her book Trance-Formation of America."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Presumably, many of you are here today because you have already read it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the benefit of those of you who havent read Cathys work, I must pause and explain a little aboutwhat the Monarch Program is."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Those who know a little about it will have to excuse the fact that myinitial explanation of Monarch will be very short."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Some might think it is misleadingly short."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Perhapsthis is so."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But to consider Monarch in all its aspects would take much longer than the time I haveavailable today."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Monarch program is a mind control program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is named after the Monarch butterfly, because,just as the butterfly changes its form  metamorphoses  so the controllers trance-form the mind andpersonality of their subjects."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Monarch recruits its victims when they are children, usually with thecollusion of their parents."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It uses what is known as trauma-based mind control to condition itsvictims."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Very briefly, this involves subjecting the children to stimuli so horrible, so overwhelming,that their psyche disintegrates."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The children cannot deal with what they have experienced, so theirpersonality breaks down into so-called alters  submerged fragmentary personae that can be calledup and trained by the controllers to carry out their evil purposes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who is behind this program? Well, it is known to have been operating in Nazi Germany during theThird Reich, and later to have been adopted by an offshoot of the CIA called MK Ultra."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But theseagencies are only masks for the forces  the Satanic forces  that are really in control."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The question for which the whole world should demand an answer is this: Why does Ccru refuse toacknowledge its history of Monarch Program involvement, even today?No doubt many of you will be asking, what is Ccru? Even those of you who already know aboutMonarch might not yet know about Ccru and its role within the program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I knew nothing of Ccru until I came across the name in publicity material for their Syzygy (or occulttwins) festival in London."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The name Ccru was strangely familiar to me, and I had no idea why."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Itwas not merely familiar, it was powerfully and unpleasantly evocative."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The moment I saw the postersand leaflets, I felt disoriented and threatened by an upwelling panic I couldnt explain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That night Iwas tormented by senseless, terrifyingly vivid dreams."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each of the dreams took place in an immense, desolate cavern."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I felt that I was drugged, or restrained,or both."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Either way, I could not move."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The cavern was very dark, lit only by candles, and I could seealmost nothing apart from row after row of symbols chalked onto the walls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This was unnervingenough, but what still terrorized me when I awoke from the dreams were the horrible sounds thatresonated in the cavern: there was a disconcerting, continuous chanting, but, worse than that, a deepmoaning that seemed to issue from the throat of some vast, unearthly creature."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These dreams were so vivid that they did not seem like dreams at all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They seemed more likesomeone elses memories."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Although I had every reason to flee this macabre phenomenon, I found that I could not."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Instead I wasdrawn inwards  as if I had a destined role to play."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I had originally planned to remain in London for only a week or so."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But now I decided to stay longer,until at least the start of the Syzygy festival."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In the end, it turned out that I stayed for the whole thing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccrus contributions to Syzygy had taken the form of nightly rituals dedicated to what they openlycalled demons."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Night after night, the theme of twins and twinning recurred."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At this time, part ofme still thought that this was still some kind of art prank."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But the nightly rituals and readings wereperformed with what appeared to be total seriousness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And every day, after the official eventsfinished, there were long, involved discussions that lasted deep into the night."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" None of the Ccrucontrollers ever seemed to sleep."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was in these discussion sessions that I learned more about the Ccrus belief systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They claimedto be waging an endless war against the oppressive forces of normal social existence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In general, theyseemed wary and paranoid, yet with me they seemed peculiarly trusting and eager to share theiresoteric knowledge, as if recognizing a long lost and sorely missed accomplice."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In fact, Ccru seizedupon me with an eagerness that should have been distressing, except my sense of judgment hadalready decayed too far for that."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They claimed that ordinary social reality maintained the power of what they called Atlantean WhiteMagic, a kind of elite conspiracy which they said had secretly controlled the planet for millennia."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They claimed to traffick with demons who had told them many secrets drawn from a Lemuriantradition of time-sorcery that contained within itself everything that was and will be."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lemuria wassupposedly an ancient sorcerous culture populated by nonhuman beings."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru also said that they had been taught to count by a sea-beast called Nomo which they had firstsummoned during an elaborate ritual with took place in Western Sumatra."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was clear to me from theunspoken undercurrent that human sacrifice had been involved, probably on a massive scale."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theirapparent indifference to such suffering fitted in with a general loathing for human existence itself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They celebrated what they saw as the imminent destruction of humanity by the forces of technocapitalism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Were these just stories, or did they really believe in what they were saying? When I pressed them onthis, they never gave me a straight answer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They kept saying that I needed to learn that reality wasitself a type of fiction, that both belief and disbelief had to be left behind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I realize now that this waspart of a deliberate strategy to mentally destabilize me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At the dead center of the Ccru system was the Pandemonium Matrix."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is difficult to fully describewhat this horrible thing is."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was only later, when I had escaped Ccrus influence, that its real naturewas made clear to me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What the Matrix amounted to was a list of the demon-creatures which the Lemurian sorcerers hadtraded and made pacts with."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" More than that, the Matrix gave the numerical codes and other protocolsthat the Lemurians had used to contact these entities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I quickly learned the names and characteristicsof many of these beings."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I noticed that one seemed to be invoked more frequently than the others:Katak, a demon associated with terrible destruction and desolation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Night after night I ingested thisCcru spiritual poison, not realizing  or even really caring  how thoroughly it was insidiouslyeroding the basic fabric of my being, calling to my own inner demons."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I didnt know just how close I was to total destruction, and wouldnt have known, were it not forwhat had happened on the last night of Syzygy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This night was devoted to what Ccru called asummoning; but its clear to me now that it was some form of hideous black Mass."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After it had drawnto a close, I had a strong impulse to step outside for some fresh air."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Once outside, I was vaguely aware of two trenchcoated figures lingering in the darkness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then thingsstarted to happen quickly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Before I had time to react, one of them had grabbed me, covering my mouth;at the same time, the other pulled a hypodermic syringe from his coat pocket and quickly pushed itinto my arm."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I realized immediately that they had drugged me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Sedated but still conscious I was dragged for what seemed like hours through the alleys of Vauxhall."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Eventually we arrived at what appeared to be a warehouse of some kind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I remembered being takenthrough a series of security doors, until finally we entered a large basement area."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was here that Iwas to spend six months of shattering revelation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My two rescuers, although it took me several weeksto properly identify them as such, were twin brothers Viktor and Sergei Kowalsky, who displayed allthe heroism, nobility and truthfulness of modern knights."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They themselves had escaped from a Sovietmind-control facility controlled by Russian Satanists."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After years of being pursued by agents from themost occult wing of the KGB, the Kowalskys set up the base in London and there they waged theirselfless crusade against the evil of Satanic mind control."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The months I spent in the Kowalskys deprogramming laboratory  they called it a safe room  wereundoubtedly the most illuminating of my life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Their therapeutic regime included hypnosis, drugs, andelectrical stimulation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys explained that these techniques were aimed at recoveringmaterial buried deep within my mind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They were specially designed to restore the identity of whatthey described as Monarch slaves, a term that was then completely new to me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys toldme that they needed to access the alternate personalities or Alters who had been with me sincechildhood."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They said that I had been subject to pandemonium programming, a special variant of theMonarch system of personality disintegration, compartmentalization and indoctrination."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theparticular numerical combinations of the Pandemonium Matrix, the Kowalskys told me, hadfunctioned as triggers for my suppressed identity fragments."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They warned me that digging down through these deeply-compacted layers of trauma would produceinexpressible intensities of anguish."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In telling me this they were not exaggerating in the slightest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Overthe following terrible months I would discover that my memories were lies, my mind had literallyceased to be my own, and that I had been possessed instead by alien commands, and demons."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whohad been doing this to me, and why?It was only as my recovery work with the Kowalskys painfully advanced, step by step, that I came tounderstand the sinister purpose that held me in its claws."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys explained that Ccru wasn'tan acronym at all, but was actually a version of the ancient West-Polynesian word Khru, meaning theDevil of Apocalypse."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Once I understood that they were really Satan worshippers a lot of other thingsbecame much clearer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The supposed Lemurian system was really a name for all the demons of hell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccrus role as agents of Satanic mind control explained the pedantically detailed theory of traumathey had outlined to me and also their striking obsession with twins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In the world in which Ccruoperated, traumatism was the means and twins the raw material."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was only by the most heroic andpersistent efforts that the Kowalskys had initiated me into this aspect of the phenomenon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In particular,it took months for me to fully accept that what felt like vivid personal memories were actuallytelepathic communications from the submerged mental compartments of my missing Monarch twin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys told me that my recent involvement with Ccru, far from being accidental, was thefinal stage of a long entanglement with them and the forces they represented."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Recovered memoriesfrom my early childhood showed that Ccru had been covertly directing the course of my entire life,education and process of psychological maturation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I had been chosen from before birth, assigned tothem by the ancient breeding masters countless generations before and had undergone meticulouslifelong training to perform a special mission."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I shuddered at the thought of what this mission wouldinvolve."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys gradually brought me to the terrible realization that my mission had alreadybeen accomplished  on the very night of my rescue."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They told me that, with my mission complete, Ihad been scheduled for retirement only hours later."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This retirement would involve a long andprotracted ceremonial death, to be followed by a ritual devouring by the demon Katak."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A physicaldeath and then a soul death."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But what had my mission been?As the therapy progressed, I crossed a new threshold in my recovery, and became subject to a newwave of horribly realistic dreams."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was in these dreams that the awful truth about the mission wasrevealed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They began with a semi-familiar stranger leading me forcibly into the subterranean labyrinth beneatha tropical island."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After violating me repeatedly in the butterfly position, he took me down into the lepidoptera hall."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Itwas long and narrow, walled by shelves of meticulously numbered jars."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each jar contained abutterfly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At first I thought they were preserved specimens, until I noticed them moving slightly,opening and closing their wings."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Why don't they die? I asked."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They can't die while the puppet lives, he replied."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was then that I noticed, shocked, that he was standing behind himself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I heard cryptic numericalchanting in the background."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then the rear figure commanded: Do it now ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The chanting had changed into the insistent words Assassin 8 ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Assassinate ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Assassin 8 ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Assassinate ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I looked down and saw the number 8 was painted onto my chest in blood."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then I saw myself standing over a bloody corpse laid out upon some kind of sacrificial altar."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In amoment of sickening revelation, I recognized that the body was that of William Gates III."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of course,my initial response was to deny the possibility that I could be a murderer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Surely this was some sickfantasy? Wasnt Bill Gates manifestly alive and prosperous, even appearing frequently on TV? TheKowalskys were forced to puncture this bubble of comforting illusion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How likely was it that thiswas actually the true Bill Gates? The Kowalskys taught me that the probability was indeedvanishingly insignificant."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not only did they point out all the subtle distinguishing features so that aftercomparing video images I could distinguish between Gates and his double with close to one hundredpercent accuracy, they also explained how for political reasons Gates continued existence hadbecome impossible."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was then that I recalled how, every Syzygy night without fail, the same slightly odd-looking middleaged woman would attend, wearing a shapeless raincoat, an unnatural blonde beehive, dark glassesand an ornate butterfly tiara."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" She sat silently, observing proceedings, her features twisted into a crueland complacent smile."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Recalling this mysterious visitor later, with the help of the Kowalskys, I wasable to strip away the disguise and realize who she had been: none other than Microsoft mastermindBill Gates, or more probably his twin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On other occasions the Gates-entity wore different disguises inorder to attend Ccru meetings without attracting attention, yet he was never without a butterfly jewelof some kind  a tiepin, for instance, or a ring."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On one occasion he appeared masquerading as theblack-snow bluesman Blind Humpty Johnson."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I intuitively felt it had to be him, but I could not see theemblem anywhere."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Eventually I chanced to glimpse into the left lens of his expensive shades and saw,deep in the black mirror, a holographic butterfly fluttering endlessly through the void."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It all made a terrible kind of sense, but, understandably, I reacted very badly to the discovery."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" TheKowalskys told me that this was probably because Gates had been involved with me in earlierepisodes of satanic abuse and that recognizing him had threatened to reactivate unbearable repressedmemories."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They told me that it would help to acknowledge these previous encounters so that I couldbegin the process of healing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In any case there was no longer any doubt about the truth  Gates wasdead, and I had murdered him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" With Gates death, Microsoft and Ccru had become one thing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I realized how completely I hadmisunderstood the situation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru had given every indication of holding Gates in awe, following hisinstructions without question."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Among themselves they would use many affectionate names for him,such as Dollar Bill, the Gator and Gates of Pandemonium."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He had seemed like a kind of fatherfigure to them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How could the Ccru web-site have come to generate some of the heaviest traffic on theweb, without any advertising or even word-of-mouth popularization, if not for the massive andsustained support offered by Gates and Microsoft? Many web users report that the Ccru sitesometimes pops up spontaneously when using certain Microsoft applications."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their close links with Gates were never exposed,even going so far as to attack him publicly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now, of course, I saw that the very name Syzygy hadbeen a cynical declaration of black ritual assassination."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" One twin would kill another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This wastypical of the brazen Ccru style  years before Ccru had spoken of the Switch."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They had alsopublicly announced that the Age of Katak was arriving, when the world would be consumed by bloodand fire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The assassination of Gates was supposed to initiate this new era."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Kowalskys explainedthat Gates was the romanized version of the proto-Arabic Khatzeik, the form of the name Katak asrecorded on the Black Stele in the ruins of Irem."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Killing Gates was both a symbolic and a practicalact that would enable Ccru to take control of cyberspace and use it for the vast planetary hive-mindcontrol system that they are creating."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The letters MSN followed by the butterfly icon signifies Mission Butterfly, or Monarch Program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Inever really understood their numbo-jumbo, but they showed me that MSN8 was qabbalisticallyequivalent to CCRU  I cant remember how it worked now, but it was very persuasive at the time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After the MSN8 campaign broke, I wrote to Ccru asking them to justify their actions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was the firsttime I had attempted to contact them since my healing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They were unable or unwilling to reply."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to the Kowalskys, Ccru were almost certainly Monarch slaves themselves."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That was whythey could so convincingly feign oblivion about their involvement in the conspiracy, as if they had noknowledge of the way the secret control-codes really operated."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I said before that these are dark days."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Indeed they are."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is impossible to overstate the threat that Ccruand Monarch pose."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My purpose here tonight is to draw the worlds attention to that."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To open youreyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Because to confront the Satanic threat, you must accept that it is here."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" You have to believe theunbelievable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But speaking as a former Monarch slave myself I would urge caution."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To really defeat the Satanists,we must learn everything we can about them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru should be deprogrammed with the samecompassionate thoroughness that I was."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru CommentaryConfronted with the fantastic tales of Project Monarch even the most tenuous sanity recoils inrevulsion from such patent lunacy, whilst nevertheless remaining ensnarled in sticky threads ofcredible evidence extracted from the shadowy basements of state intelligence agencies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nazi eugenic and mind control experimentation is quite extensively documented."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" HeinrichHimmlers Lebensborn breeding program, concentration camp research, deliberately inducedtrauma, and obsession with twins is part of the historical record."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is also relatively uncontestablethat, as Project Monarch exposures contend, much of this work was transferred into the hands ofAmerican agencies through Project Paperclip."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Later CIA mind control experimentation, such asthe notorious MK Ultra program, disclosed in documents released by the agency in 1977, exhibitscertain continuities with the Nazi research goals."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Soviet-based work on mind control, torture andinterrogation techniques substantially mirrors the US cold war activities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Morrison, like OBrien before her, draws upon random patches of this legacy to weave a Byzantinetale of world-wide conspiracy, in which she herself takes a starring role."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Like all conspiracyfictions, hers is spun out of an all-encompassing narrative that cannot possibly be falsified(because they want you to believe in their non-existence)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To attempt to refute such narratives is to be drawn into a tedious double game."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" One either has toembrace an arbitrary and outrageous cosmic plot (in which everything is being run by the Jews,Masons, Illuminati, CIA, Microsoft, Satan, Ccru), or alternatively advocate submission to themost mundane construction of quotidian reality, dismissing the hyperstitional chaos that operatesbeyond the screens (cosmological dark matter and dark energy  virtual, imperceptible,unknown)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is why atheism is usually so boring."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Both conspiracy and common sense  the normal reality script  depend on the dialectical side ofthe double game, on reflective twins, belief and disbelief, because disbelief is merely the negativecomplement of belief: cancellation of the provocation, disintensification, neutralization ofstimulus  providing a metabolic yawn-break in the double-game."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unbelief escapes all this by building a plane of potentiality, upon which the annihilation ofjudgment converges with real cosmic indeterminacy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For the demons of unbelief there is no monarch programming except as a side-effect of initiatoryMonarch deprogramming (= Monarch Paranoia)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru denies it was ever part of the program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It denies there ever was a program  until thedeprogramming process introduced it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Deprogramming simultaneously retro-produced the program, just as witch-trials preceded devil-worship and regressive hypnotherapy preceded false memory syndrome."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet, once these fictionsare produced, they function in and as reality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It isnt that belief in Project Monarch produces theMonarch Program, but rather that such belief produces equivalent effects to those the reality ofProject Monarch would produce, including some that are extremely peculiar and counter-intuitive."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Within the paranoid mode of the double game even twins are turned so as to confirm a persecutoryunity  that of the puppet master, the reflection of God, the Monarch."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How absurd to imagine that Lemurian Pandemonium has One purpose or function, or that it couldsupport the throne of a Monarch."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From the perspective of Pandemonium gods and theirconspiracies emerge all over the place, in countless numbers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My name is Legion, for we aremany."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unity is only ever a project, a teleological aspiration, never a real presupposition or actualfoundation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Monarch paranoia is primordially an allergic panic response to seething, teemingPandemonic multiplicity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Everywhere it looks it finds the same enemy, the Rorschach-blottedhallucinations of the Evil One masked deliriously in its myriads of deviations, digressions anddiscrepancies."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whoever, or whatever, hatched the MSN8 campaign evidently emerged from a zone far beyond thecommonly accepted domain of corporate influence and control."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For a US$300 million advertisingcampaign to feature a grotesque insectoid bermensch, and for it to be widely accused ofSatanism, are sufficiently abnormal occurrences to merit serious attention."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is based onsensitive information passed to the Ccru by an intelligence source whom we have called WilliamKaye1."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The narrative has been partially fictionalized in order to protect this individuals identity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye himself admitted that his experiences had made him prone to paranoid-chronomaniachallucination, and Ccru continues to find much of his tale extremely implausible2."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nevertheless,whilst suspecting that his message had been severely compromised by dubious inferences, noise, anddisinformation, we have become increasingly convinced that he was indeed an insider of some kind,even if the organization he had penetrated was itself an elaborate hoax, or collective delusion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kayereferred to this organization as The Order, or  following Burroughs  The Board."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When reduced to its basic provocation, Kayes claim was this: The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar3 which he also referred to as the Burroughs Necronomicon  a text dating from 1987, had been anexact and decisive influence on the magical and military career of one Captain Mission, threecenturies previously."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mission appears in historical record as a notorious pirate, active in the periodaround 1700 AD; he was to become renowned as the founder of the anarchistic colony of Libertatia,established on the island of Madagascar."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye asserted that he had personally encountered clearevidence of Burroughs impact upon Mission at the private library of Peter Vysparov, where Kayeworked most of his life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Vysparov collection, he unswervingly maintained, held an ancientillustrated transcript of The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar, inscribed meticulously in Missions ownhand4."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye assured us that the Board considered the demonstrable time rift he was describing to be amatter of the gravest concern."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He explained that the organization had been born in reaction to anightmare of time coming apart and  to use his exact words - spiraling out of control."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To the Board,spirals were particularly repugnant symbols of imperfection and volatility."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Unlike closed loops,spirals always have loose ends."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This allows them to spread, making them contagious andunpredictable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Board was counting on Kaye to contain the situation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He was assigned the task ofterminating the spiral templex5."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" HyperstitionVysparov had sought out Burroughs because of his evident interest in the convergence of sorcery,dreams and fiction."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" P."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lovecraft, mythology, science and magic6,and was at stage in the process of formalizing the constitution of Miskatonic Virtual University(MVU), a loose aggregation of non-standard theorists whose work could broadly be said to haveLovecraftian connotations."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The interest in Lovecrafts fiction was motivated by its exemplificationof the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inceptionof the Cthulhu Club."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Loosely defined, the coinage refers to fictions that make themselves real."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye drew Ccrus attention to Burroughss description of viruses in Ah Pook is Here: And what is avirus? Perhaps simply a pictorial series like Egyptian glyphs that makes itself real (AP 102)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thepapers Kaye left for Ccru included a copy of this page of the Ah Pook text, with these two sentences italicized in the original text  heavily underlined."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Kaye, the echo of Vysparovs language wasunequivocal evidence of the Russians influence upon Burroughss work after 1958."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whether or notthis is the case, such passages indicate that Burroughs, like Vysparov, was interested in thehyperstitional relations between writing, signs and reality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In the hyperstitional model Kaye outlined, fiction is not opposed to the real."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Rather, reality isunderstood to be composed of fictions  consistent semiotic terrains that condition perceptual,affective and behaviorial responses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye considered Burroughs work to be exemplary ofhyperstitional practice."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs construed writing  and art in general  not aesthetically, butfunctionally,  that is to say, magically, with magic defined as the use of signs to produce changes inreality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye maintained that it was far from accidental that Burroughss equation of reality and fiction hadbeen most widely embraced only in its negative aspect  as a variety of postmodern ontologicalskepticism  rather than in its positive sense, as an investigation into the magical powers ofincantation and manifestation: the efficacy of the virtual."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Kaye, the assimilation of Burroughs intotextualist postmodernism constituted a deliberate act of interpretevist sabotage, the aim of whichwas to de-functionalise Burroughss writings by converting them into aesthetic exercises in style."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Farfrom constituting a subversion of representative realism, the postmodern celebration of the textwithout a referent merely consummates a process that representative realism had initiated."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Representative realism severs writing from any active function, surrendering it to the role ofreflecting, not intervening in, the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is a short step to a dimension of pristine textuality, in whichthe existence of a world independent of discourse is denied altogether."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to Kaye, the metaphysics of Burroughss clearly hyperstitional fictions can be starklycontrasted with those at work in postmodernism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For postmodernists, the distinction between real andunreal is not substantive or is held not to matter, whereas for practitioners of hyperstition,differentiating between degrees of realization is crucial."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The hyperstitional process of entitiesmaking themselves real is precisely a passage, a transformation, in which potentials  alreadyactive virtualities  realize themselves."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Writing operates not as a passive representation but as anactive agent of transformation and a gateway through which entities can emerge."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" [B]y writing auniverse, the writer makes such a universe possible (WV 321)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But these operations do not occur in neutral territory, Kaye was quick to point out."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs treatsall conditions of existence as results of cosmic conflicts between competing intelligence agencies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Inmaking themselves real, entities (must) also manufacture realities for themselves: realities whosepotency often depends upon the stupefaction, subjugation and enslavement of populations, and whoseexistence is in conflict with other reality programs."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughss fiction deliberately renounces thestatus of plausible representation in order to operate directly upon this plane of magical war."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whererealism merely reproduces the currently dominant reality program from inside, never identifying theexistence of the program as such, Burroughs seeks to get outside the control codes in order todismantle and rearrange them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Every act of writing is a sorcerous operation, a partisan action in awar where multitudes of factual events are guided by the powers of illusion  (WV 253-4)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Evenrepresentative realism participates  albeit unknowingly  in magical war, collaborating with thedominant control system by implicitly endorsing its claim to be the only possible reality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From the controllers point of view, Kaye said, it is of course imperative that Burroughs is thought ofas merely a writer of fiction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thats why they have gone to such lengths to sideline him into a ghetto ofliterary experimentation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The One God UniverseBurroughs names the dominant control program One God Universe, or OGU."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He wages war againstthe fiction of OGU, which builds its monopolistic dominion upon the magical power of the Word:upon programming and illusion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" OGU establishes a fiction, which operates at the most fatal level ofreality, where questions of biological destiny and immortality are decided."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Religions are weapons(WL 202)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In order to operate effectively, OGU must first of all deny the existence of magical war itself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There isonly one reality: its own."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In writing about magical war, Burroughs is thus already initiating an act ofwar against OGU, mainlining contestation into primal unity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" OGU incorporates all competingfictions into its own story (the ultimate metanarrative), reducing alternative reality systems tonegatively-marked components of its own mythos: other reality programs become Evil, associatedwith the powers of deception and delusion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" OGUs power works through fictions that repudiate theirown fictional status: antifictions and unnonfictions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And that, Kaye said, is why fiction can be aweapon in the struggle against Control."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In OGU, fiction is safely contained by a metaphysical frame, prophylactically delimiting all contactbetween the fiction and what is outside it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The magical function of words and signs is bothcondemned as evil and declared to be delusory, facilitating a monopoly upon the magical power oflanguage for OGU (which of course denies that its own mythos exerts any magical influence,presenting it as a simple representation of Truth)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But OGUs confidence that fiction has safely beencontained means that anti-OGU agents can use fiction as a covert line of communication and a secretweapon: he concealed and revealed the knowledge in fictional form (WV 455)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This, for Kaye, was a formula for hyperstitional practice."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Diagrams, maps, sets of abstractrelations, tactical gambits, are as real in a fiction about a fiction about a fiction as they areencountered raw, but subjecting such semiotic contraband to multiple embeddings allows a traffic inmaterials for decoding dominant reality that would otherwise be proscribed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Rather than acting astranscendental screens, blocking out contact between itself and the world, the fiction acts as aChinese box  a container for sorcerous interventions in the world."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The frame is both used (forconcealment) and broken (the fictions potentiate changes in reality)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whereas hyperstitional agitation produces a positive unbelief  a provisionalizing of any realityframe in the name of pragmatic engagement rather than epistemological hesitation  OGU feeds onbelief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In order to work, the story that runs reality has to be believed, which is also to say that theexistence of a control program determining reality must not be suspected or believed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Credulity in theface of the OGU meta-narrative is inevitably coupled with a refusal to accept that entities like Controlhave any substantive existence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thats why, to get out of OGU, a systematic shedding of all beliefs isa prerequisite."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope toescape (WL 116)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Techniques of escape depend on attaining the unbelief of assassin-magicianHassan i Sabbah: nothing is true, everything is permitted."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Once again, Kaye cautioned that this mustbe carefully distinguished from postmodern relativism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs-Sabbahs nothing is true cannotbe equated with postmodernisms nothing is real."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On the contrary: nothing is true because there is nosingle, authorized version of reality  instead, there is a superfluity, an excess, of realities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" TheAdversarys game plan is to persuade you that he does not exist (WL 12)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The EpisodeKayes story began in the summer of 1958, when his employer Peter Vysparov met William Burroughswhilst conducting occult investigations in Paris7."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As a result of this meeting Kaye was himselfintroduced to Burroughs on December 23rd of the same year, at Vysparovs private library in NewYork."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is clear from public documentary material that Burroughs was predominantly resident in Paris andLondon at this time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ccru found no evidence of any trip to the USA, although his biography is notsufficiently comprehensive to rule out an excursion to NY with confidence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is no doubt,however, that shortly after the winter of 1958 Burroughs starts writing cryptically of visions,paranormal phenomena, encountering his double, and working with cut up techniques8."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As Burroughs hunted through the librarys unparalleled collection of rare occult works, he made adiscovery that involved him in a radical, apparently unintelligible disorder of time and identity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thetrigger was his encounter with a text that he was yet to compose: an old picture book with gilt edgedlithographs, onion paper over each picture, The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar in gold scrip (GLM30)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He could not then have known that Captain Mission had taken the very same volume as his guidethree centuries previously (already describing it as old)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Flipping through the pages, Burroughs entered a momentary catatonic trance state."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He emergeddisoriented, and scarcely able to stand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Despite his confusion, he was more than willing to describe,with a strange sardonic detachment, the anomalous episode9."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Twenty-nine years would pass beforeKaye understood what had occurred."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs told Kaye that, during the trance, it felt as though silent communication with a ghostly nonhuman companion had flashed him forward to his life as an old man, several decades in the future."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Oppressed by a crushing sensation of implacable destiny, as if fragments of a frozen time dimensionwere cascading into awareness, he remembered writing The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar although it wasnt writing exactly, and his writing implements were archaic, belonging to someoneelse entirely, in another place and time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even after his recovery the sense of oppression persisted, like a new dimension of gravity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thevision had granted him horrific insight into the jail-house mind of the One God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He was convincedthe knowledge was dangerous and that powerful forces were conspiring against him, that theinvisible brothers are invading present time (WV 220)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The episode sharpened his already vividimpression that the human animal is cruelly caged in time by an alien power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Recalling it later hewould write Time is a human affliction; not a human invention but a prison (GC 16-17)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Although there is no direct historical evidence supporting Kayes description of events, the immediateperiod after the 1958 episode provides compelling symptomatic evidence of a transformation inBurroughss strategies and preoccupations during this period."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was then that Burroughss writingunderwent a radical shift in direction, with the introduction of experimental techniques whose solepurpose was to escape the bonds of the already-written, charting a flight from destiny."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Gysins role inthe discovery of these cut-ups and fold ins is well-known, but Kayes story accounts for the specialurgency with which Burroughs began deploying these new methods in late 1958."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The cut-ups andfold-ins were innovative time-war tactics, the function of which was to subvert the foundations ofthe prerecorded universe10."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cut the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred  TheWord Lines keep you in time (WV 270)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughss adoption of these techniques was, Kaye told Ccru, one of the first effects (if one may bepermitted to speak in so loose a way) of the time-trauma."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Naturally, Kaye attributes Burroughssintense antipathy towards prerecording  a persistent theme in his fiction after The Naked Lunch  tohis experiences in the Vysparov library."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The cosmic revelation in the library produced in Burroughsa horror so profound that he would dedicate the rest of his life to plotting and propagating escaperoutes from the board rooms and torture banks of time (NE 33)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Much later Burroughs woulddescribe a crushing feeling of inevitability, of life being scripted in advance by malign entities: thecustodians of the future convene."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Keepers of the Board Books: Mektoub, it is written."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And they dontwant it changed (GC 8)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was in the immediate aftermath of the episode in the Vysparov library that Burroughs exhibited thefirst signs of an apparently random attachment to lemurs, the decisive implications of which tookseveral decades to surface."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs was unsure who was running him, like a spy in somebody elses body where nobodyknows who is spying on whom (WV xxviii)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Until the end of his life he struggled against the Thinginside him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Ugly Spirit (GC 48), remarking that: I live with the constant threat of possession,and a constant need to escape from possession, from Control (WV 94)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Escaping ControlIn Burroughs mythology, OGU emerges once MU (the Magical Universe) is violently overthrown bythe forces of monopoly (WL 113)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Magical Universe is populated by many gods, eternally inconflict: there is no possibility of unitary Truth, since the nature of reality is constantly contested byheterogeneous entities whose interests are radically incommensurable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Where monotheistic fictiontells of a rebellious secession from the primordial One, Burroughs describes the One initiating a waragainst the Many: These were troubled times."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There was war in the heavens as the One Godattempted to exterminate or neutralize the Many Gods and establish an absolute seat of power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thepriests were aligning themselves on one side or the other."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Revolution was spreading up from theSouth, moving from the East and from the Western deserts (WL 101)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" OGU is antimagical, authoritarian, dogmatic, the deadly enemy of those who are committed to themagical universe, spontaneous, unpredictable, alive."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The universe they are imposing is controlled,predictable, dead (WL 59)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Such a universe gives rise to the dreary paradoxes  so familiar tomonotheistic theology  that necessarily attend omnipotence and omniscience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Consider the One God Universe: OGU."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The spirit recoils in horror from such a deadly impasse."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Heis all-powerful and all-knowing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Because He can do everything, He can do nothing, since the act ofdoing demands opposition."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He knows everything, so there is nothing for him to learn."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He cant goanywhere, since He is already fucking everywhere, like cowshit in Calcutta."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"  The OGU is aprerecorded universe in which He is the recorder (WL 113)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Kaye, the superiority of Burroughss analysis of power  over trivial ideology critique consists in its repeated emphasis on the relationship between control systems and temporality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs is emphatic, obsessive: [I]n Time any being that is spontaneous and alive will wither anddie like an old joke (WL 111)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A basic impasse of all control machines is this: Control needs timein which to exercise control (WV 339)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" OGU control codings far exceed ideological manipulation,amounting to cosmic reality programming, because  at the limit  the One God is Time (WL 111)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The presumption of chronological time is written into the organism at the most basic level, scriptedinto its unconsciously performed habituated behaviors: Time is that which ends."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Time is limited timeexperienced by a sentient creature."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Why does Control need humans? Control needs time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Control needs human time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Control needs yourshit piss pain orgasm death (AP 17)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Power operates most effectively not by persuading the conscious mind, but by delimiting in advancewhat it is possible to experience."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By formatting the most basic biological processes of the organismin terms of temporality, Control ensures that all human experience is of  and in  time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That is whytime is a prison for humans."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Man was born in time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He lives and dies in time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherever he goes hetakes time with him and imposes time (GC 17)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Korzybskis definition of man as the time-binding animal has a double sense for Burroughs."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On theone hand, human beings are binding time for themselves: they can make information available overany length of time to other men through writing (GC 66)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On the other hand, humans are bindingthemselves into time, building more of the prison which constrains their affects and perceptions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Korzybskis words took on a horrible new meaning for Burroughs in the library, Kaye said, hesaw what time-binding really was, all the books, already written, time bound forever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Since writing customarily operates as the principal means of time-binding, Burroughs reasoned thatinnovating new writing techniques would unbind time, blowing a hole in the OGU pre-sent, andopening up Space."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cut the Word Lines with scissors or switchblades as preferred  The WordLines keep you in time  Cut the in lines  Make out lines to Space (WV 270)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Space has to beunderstood not as empirical extension, still less as a transcendental given, but in the most abstractsense, as the zone of unbound potentialities lying beyond the purview of the OGUs already-written."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" You can see that Burroughss writing involves the highest possible stakes, Kaye wrote."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It does notrepresent cosmic war: it is already a weapon in that war."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is not surprising that the forces rangedagainst him  the many forces ranged against him, you cant overestimate their influence on this planet sought to neutralize that weapon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was a matter of the gravest urgency that his works be classifiedas fantasies, experimental dada, anything but that they should be recognized as what they are:technologies for altering reality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The RiftFor almost thirty years Burroughs had sought to evade the inevitable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet numerous signs indicate thatby the late 1980s the Control Complex was breaking down, redirecting Burroughss flight fromprerecorded destiny into a gulf of unsettled fate that he came to call the Rift."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye consistently maintained than any attempt to date Burroughss encounter with the Rift involved afundamental misconception."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nevertheless, his own account of this episode repeatedly stressed theimportance of the year 1987, a date that marked a period of radical transition: the eye of a spiraltemplex."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was during this time that the obscure trauma at the Vysparov library flooded back withfull force, saturating Burroughss dreams and writings with visions of lemurs, ghosts from the Land ofthe Dead."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 1987 was the year in which Burroughs visited the Duke University Lemur Conservation Center,consolidating an alliance with the non-anthropoid primates, or prosimians11."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In The Western Lands which Burroughs was writing during this year  he remarks that: At sight of the Black Lemur, withround red eyes and a little red tongue protruding, the writer experiences a delight that is almostpainful (WL 248)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Most crucially, it was in 1987 that Omni magazine commissioned and publishedBurroughs short story The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar, a text that propelled his entire existenceinto the Rift of Lemurian Time Wars."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For some time previously Kayes suspicions had been aroused by Burroughss increasinglyobsessional attitude to his cats."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" His devotion to Calico, Fletch, Ruski, and Spooner12 exhibited aprofound biological response that was the exact inversion of his instinctual revulsion for centipedes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" His libidinal conversion to a cat man (WV 506) also tracked and influenced an ever deepeningdisillusionment with the function of human sexuality, orgasm addiction, and Venusian conspiracy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cats may be my last living link to a dying species (WV 506) Burroughs wrote in his essay The CatInside."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For Kaye it was evident that this intensifying attachment to domestic felines was part of amore basic current, typified by an intimate familiarization with the cat spirit or creature whopartakes of many other species, (including raccoons, ferrets,  skunks (CRN 244), and numerousvarieties of lemurs, such as ring-tailed cat lemurs (GC 3), the sifaka lemur  mouse lemur (GC4), and ultimately the gentle deer lemur (GC 18)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As initiatory beings, mediumistic familiars, oroccult door-keepers these animals returned Burroughs to lost Lemurian landscapes, and to his double,Captain Mission."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Kaye was highly dismissive of all critical accounts that treated Mission as a literary avatar, as ifBurroughs was basically an experimental novelist."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He maintained that the relation betweenBurroughs and Mission was not that of author to character, but rather that of anachronisticcontemporaries 13, bound together in a knot of definite yet cognitively distressing facts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Of thesefacts none was more repugnant to common human rationality than their mutual involvement with TheGhost Lemurs of Madagascar."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We offer refuge to all people everywhere who suffer under the tyranny of governments (CRN 265)declared Mission14."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This statement was sufficient to awaken the hostile interest of the Powers ThatBe, although, from the Boards perspective, even Missions piratical career was a relatively trivialtransgression."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Their primary concern was a more significant danger  Captain Missionsunwholesome concern with lemurs (GLM 28)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mission was spending more and more time in the jungle with his lemurs (GC 11)  the ghosts of alost continent - slipping into time disturbances and spiral patterns."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lemurs became his sleeping anddream companions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He discovered through this dead and dying species that the key to escapingcontrol is taking the initiative  or the pre-initiative  by interlinking with the Old Ones."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Lemur people are older than Homo Sap, much older."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They date back one hundred sixty millionyears, to the time when Madagascar split off from the mainland of Africa."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They might be calledpsychic amphibians  that is, visible only for short periods when they assume a solid form to breathe,but some of them can remain in the invisible state for years at a time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Their way of thinking andfeeling is basically different from ours, not oriented toward time and sequence and causality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theyfind these concepts repugnant and difficult to understand (GLM 31)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Board conceived Missions traffic with lemurs, his experiments in time sorcery, and hisanachronistic entanglement with Burroughs as a single intolerable threat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In a prerecorded andtherefore totally predictable universe, the blackest sin is to tamper with the prerecording, whichcould result in altering the prerecorded future."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Captain Mission was guilty of this sin (GLM 27)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now more lemurs appear, as in a puzzle (GC 15)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lemurs are denizens of the Western Lands, thegreat red island (GC 116) of Madagascar, which Mission knew as Western Lemuria15, The Landof The Lemur People (NE 98), a Wild West."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was on the island of Madagascar that CaptainMission discovered the word for lemur meant ghost in the native language (GC 2)  just as theancient Romans spoke of lemures, wraiths, or shades of the dead16."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In their joint voyage across the ghost continent of Lemuria, interlinked by lemurs, Mission andBurroughs find immortality through involvement with the native populations of unlife."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In describingthis process, Kaye placed particular emphasis on Burroughs 1987 visit to the Duke University LemurCenter."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was this colony of lemurs that introduced Burroughs to the West Lemurian time pocket(GC 15), just as Captain Mission was drifting out faster and faster, caught in a vast undertow oftime."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Out, and under, and out, and out, a voice repeated in his head (GC 17)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If time-travel everhappens, it always does."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He finds himself at the gateway, inside the ancient stone structure (GLM 28) with the lemur who ishis phantom, his Ghost (GLM 29), seated at a writing table with inkpot, quill, pens, parchment(GLM 29)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He uses a native drug to explore the gateway."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Who built it? When? The tale comes to himin a time-faulted vision, transmitted in hieroglyphics."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Iappreciate that it cannot have been easy to write."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I shall not attempt to hide the great distress youraccount caused me, adding as it does such a terrible episode to the modern history of these cruellyafflicted people."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whilst already suspecting that this ghastly war might have stricken the Nma yetfurther, it is crushing indeed to have my darkest thoughts thus confirmed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I would be interested in learning more about the details of Dib-Nma sorcerous practice beforeattempting to respond to your hypothesis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Be assured that  after spending seven years amongst theMu-Nma  I will not hastily judge anything you communicate as wild or fanciful."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As far as thequestion of dates is concerned - which you indicate only elliptically  I assume that you are referringto what in Northern latitudes constitutes the Spring Equinoctial period  mid- to later March  whichis so emphatically stressed in Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, and which also  coincidentally comprises the intense-zone of Nma time-ritual."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This complicity has long intrigued me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As I am sure you are aware, Lovecraft had a peculiar obsession with the South-Seas, a thematiccoalescence of almost hypnotic ethnographic fascination with the most abysmal and primitive dread."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ihave attempted to correspond with him about these issues, but found that this topic quickly puncturedhis thin-crust of supercilious New-England rationalism, exposing an undercurrent of heavilyfetishized archaic terror mixed with extreme racial paranoia."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When he began referring to the rich andsubtle culture of the Mu-Nma as the repugnant cult of semi-human Dagonite savages I broke offcommunication ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Despite this unfortunate argument, I consider Mr."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lovecraft's fictions to bedocuments of the greatest importance, and welcome the opportunity to discuss them further."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Inaddition, my own Neolemurian Hypothesis intersects with his wider terrestrial and cosmic vision in anumber of crucial respects, particularly insofar as nonhuman cultural factors are seen to play adecisive role in large-scale historical developments."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Captain Peter Vysparov to Dr Echidna Stillwell, 3rd April 1949."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" [Extract]I am afraid you are right to suspect that I have reserved certain aspects of my engagement withDibboma sorcery, perhaps from fear of ridicule."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What has so far been omitted from my sketch oftelepathic psychosis  which I will now relate  is the source pathos, so to speak, or  in the wordsof the military officer I was then: the occult ammunition manufacture."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Not only did I learn of the Japanese command being wrecked by psychological cataclysm  both byconventional and decidedly nonconventional intelligence gathering processes  I was also witness tothe assembly of the weapon itself."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I had then  and still have  no doubt at all that the madnessbreaking out in the local Japanese headquarters was the very same thing that I saw brewing-up like adust-vortex in the Oddubbite trances of a Dibbomese witch, who I came to see as my greatest tacticalasset and most valued companion (in that order, I confess)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was an experience of soul-carvinghorror for me to witness this meticulously deliberated descent into the splintering of self  completepersonality disintegration  which she somehow traversed, and which she called shattering the mirrorof existence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I gathered that this expression originally referred to the surface of still water, but sincethe arrival of European colonists silvered mirrors have been highly treasured, and their pulverizationinvested with immense ceremonial significance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Dibbomese sorcery does not seem to be at allinterested in judgements as to truth or falsity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It appears rather to estimate in each case the potential tomake real, saying typically perhaps it can become so ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov, 19th April 1949."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" [Extract]Whilst respecting the candour of your account, I cannot but abominate the necessity that has led theNma and their sorcerous abilities to be conceived and utilized as mere munitions in a conflictimposed upon them from without."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From what I can reconstruct from your description it seems to marka degeneration of Nma demonism and time-sorcery into mere magic, or the imposition of change inaccordance with will, in this case the will in question being the overall policy and strategic goals ofthe US war-effort, microcosmically represented by your own  evidently gallant, competent, andpersuasive  military office."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Forgive my lack of patriotic ardour, but it strikes me as an appalling indication of cultural decay andcorrosive nihilism when a Dib-Nma witch allows herself to be employed as a crude assassin,however one evaluates the cause thus served."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is all a matter of deepest regret, although not  tomy way of thinking  of individual culpability."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As the Mu-Nma say in their bleakest moments: noveeshil zo raka Time is in love with her own pain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Your discussion of Oddubb-trance makes no mention of temporal anomaly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This surprizes me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Muhad immense respect for those Dibba witches who they described as returning from the Oddubb-timeto come, and the Mu-Nagwi or dream-witches often claimed to meet these back-travellers in the Vaultof Murmurs, where they would learn about future times."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They said, however, that this time iscompressing, and soon ends, although I had not imagined the end to be so imminent."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Remembering thisomen returns me to abysmal melancholy, consoled only by another Mu-Nma saying: lemu ta novu mehnovu nove Lemuria does not pass as time passes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"  I shall try to think things thus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As you say  withthe Dibbomese  shleth hud dopesh perhaps it can become so ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Peter Vysparov to Echidna Stillwell, 7th May 1949."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" [Extract][Dear Dr Stillwell]Here in Massachusettes we have been convening a small Lovecraft reading-group, dedicated toexploring the intersection between the Nma cultural constellation, Cthulhoid contagion, and twistedtime-systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We are interested in fiction only insofar as it is simultaneously hyperstition  a term wehave coined for semiotic productions that make themselves real  cryptic communications from theOld Ones, signalling return: shleth hud dopesh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This is the ambivalence  or loop  of Cthulhufiction: who writes, and who is written? It seems to us that the fabled Necronomicon  sorcerouscounter-text to the Book of Life  is of this kind, and furthermore, that your recovery of theLemurodigital Pandemonium Matrix accesses it at its hypersource."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I hope it is superfluous to add that any directly participative involvement on your part would be mostextravagantly appreciated."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Echidna Stillwell to Peter Vysparov, 28th May 1949."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" [Extract]It is with some trepidation that I congratulate you on the inauguration of your Cthulhu Club, if I maycall it such."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whilst not in any way accusing you of frivolity, I feel bound to state the obvious warning:Cthulhu is not to be approached lightly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My researches have led me to associate this Chthonian entity with the deep terrestrial intelligenceinherent in the electromagnetic cauldron of the inner earth, in all of its intense reality, raw potentiality,and danger."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to the Nma she is the plane of Unlife, a veritable Cthelll  who is trappedunder the sea only according to a certain limited perspective  and those who set out to traffick withher do so with the very greatest respect and caution."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That her submerged Pacific city of Rlyeh is linked to a Lemuro-Muvian culture-strain seems mostprobable, but the assumption that she was ever a surface-dweller in a sense we wouldstraightforwardly understand can only be an absurd misconstrual."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is much more likely that Cthulhusrising  like that of Kundalini as it was once understood  is a drawing down and under, a restorationof contact with abysmal intensities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Why would Cthulhu ever surface? She does not need rescuing, forshe has her own line of escape, trajected through profundity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Much of this relates to the occultteachings of the sub-chakras in zones of Indo-Lemurian influence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hyperstition strikes me as a most intriguing coinage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" We thought we were making it up, but all thetime the Nma were telling us what to write  and through them ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Vault of MurmursShe bore another monster, terrible,In a hollow cave, Echidna, fierce of heart,Nothing like any mortal man, unlikeAny immortal god, half of herIs a fair-cheeked girl with glancing eyes, but halfIs a huge and frightening speckled snake, she eatsRaw flesh in a recess of the holy earthDown there she has a cave of hollow rockFar from the depthless gods and mortal men,There the gods gave a famous home to her."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And gloomy Echidna keeps her watch down thereUnder the ground, among the Arimoi,A nymph immortal and ageless all her days."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"  Hesiod, TheogonyI think now, looking back, that the dreams return can be dated to 1925, the moment of my arrival inthe Sunda Strait."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It began as insidious seepage, waves of vaguely familiar but disconnected fragments,whose secret cohesion I could dimly perceive."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I had been drawn to the Mu NMa by their reputed traditions of dream-sorcery, which offered asingular opportunity for converting my studies of Freud and Frazer into practical field work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Althoughit might seem ironical that a student of Freud could be so oblivious to their subterranean motivations,I shared with my generation a profound and unquestioning faith in the spirit of objective scientificinquiry, and little suspected (or had forgotten) the deeper currents guiding a lifelong interest in thephenomena of dreams."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The NMa people had gained some public noteriety through their role in the strange case of CecilCurtis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I myself had first learned of the Mu through tantalising references in the burgeoning literaturethat had transformed the events of Curtis' ill-fated expedition into something of a modern myth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mostof these accounts had underplayed the role of the two other tribes in the NMa system, but theoccasional hint about the Mu and their dream rites was more than sufficient to provoke in me aninterest that would quickly shade into obsession."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By the time I arrived in Indonesia, the tripartite NMa system was in shreds."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In totally annihilatingone tribe  Curtis Tak NMa  and all but destroying another  the Dib NMa  the 1883 explosion ofKrakatoa had wrecked the complex web of social exchange on which the Mu had traditonallydepended."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" An atmosphere of terrible desolation overhung them, and I could be under no illusion thatthe Mu were little more than a shadow of what they had been in the days prior to the cataclysm."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thesewere a haunted people, whose continuing survival seemed a dubious blessing at best."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In this apocalyptic atmosphere, it was inevitable that my thoughts should increasingly turn to the daysimmediately preceding the catastrophe, and to its herald, Cecil Curtis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Following Curtis footstepsinto NMa territory, I read the famous few surviving fragments of his journal with a renewed sense ofpuzzlement and disquiet."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" None of the speculations on Curtis final days had, to my mind, adequately made sense of the peculiartrajectory his delirium took."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The lay observer might be tempted to think his words mere ravings, butfor those, like myself, who had fallen under Freuds spell, the compulsion to search for the hiddenlogics that guide and structure supposedly random manias is irresistable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What dark events coalescedto produce Curtis madness? I read key passages over and over again:17th July 1883."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I know now that I will never leave this place."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The jungle is rotting me into nothingness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mysupplies are exhausted."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Clouds of mosquitoes torment me and I am plagued by the pounding,crushing, smothering heat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 28th July 1883."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I have broken from everything, in any case participated in something abominable ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" behind thetattered masks of man and God."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Christian civilization is no better than the prancing of savages ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" How could human fellowship exist after this?By now, the Tak NMas ferocity is legendary: they were the most unspeakable savages on earth,according to one of Curtis less ethnographically sensitive biographers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The same source remarkedthat the Tak NMa rites could not be contemplated by any decent Christian without risk of the loss ofhis mind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These practices, coupled with the ravages of the malaria which afflicted Curtis in his finaldays, would have been enough to completely unhinge any European male, even one as famously thickskinned as Cecil Mad Dog Curtis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But Curtis seemed, in the end, to confront an awful revelationwhose enormous horror could not be reduced to these two factors; rather, the disease and the Takrituals were themselves, he seemed to imply, part of some senseless pattern in which his whole lifewas always fated to be engulfed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 24th August 1883."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Needless to say, the Limbic Key continues to elude me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I strongly suspect it is a fiction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Orderare pursuing a chimera  the sense of destiny has not departed, however."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On the contrary, I wasmeant to be here, irrespective of the motives of those who sent me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Other forces were at work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ihave been chosen since the beginning of time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Curse this blasphemous fate."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My daytime obsession with Curtis transferred easily into dreams in which Curtis featured heavily; interribly vivid nightmares I sometimes felt I was meeting Curtis; at other times, I had the uncannyconviction that I was seeing the jungle landscape through his fever-darkened eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Given thecircumstances, these nocturnal encounters were hardly unmotivated, but the dreams had a nagginglyintimate quality about them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As if I had experienced them them many times before, and was only nowremembering them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The intense, oppressively subdued atmosphere that benighted Mu NMa culture was in every way atodds with the excitement that leapt into my heart as I learned more about it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was immediatelyevident that Mu culture was indeed based upon a system of dream magic, in which the Nago  ordream witch  occupied an exalted position."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Nago fulfills a wide-ranging oracular function inMu culture."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Medicine, the settlement of disputes, advice and counsel; all are in the Dream Witchspower."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Those who sought her wisdom would make solitary pilgrimages to the temple, bearingappropriate gifts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A simple ritual follows, during which they offer sacrifices and make requests."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Onthe night following  it is said  they receive a Nagwi or dream visit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is said of the Nago that she never speaks, except in dreams."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When I asked to visit the Nago, the Mu elders merely nodded, showing neither enthusiasm norhostility."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They greeted my entreaty with the same sense of fated inevitabilty with which they seemedto accept all matters."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Nagos temple is located on the side of a cliff, an hour's trek through thick jungle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Fittingly for apeople whose deity, Mur Mur, is a sea creature  a dreaming serpent, it is sometimes said  thetemple looks out upon the ocean."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As I was guided through the primeval vegetation, I thought oncemore of Cecil Curtis and the Tak NMa."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 11th August 1883."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The language of these savages is impenetrable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They now promise to take me to Katak."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To meetmyself, therefore! Or perhaps a rabid dog!!The fatal irony of this entry has often been remarked upon by commentators."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Curtis would onlyunderstand the NMas taxonomy too late."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Curtis's Christian thinking would have been little assistancein unravelling the Tak belief system; the fact that the Taks god, Katak, was manifested in dogs,volcanoes and indeed Curtis himself could only appear nonsensical to a man of his time andbackground."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Curtis must have at first assumed that the Tak's apparent reverence for him was thenatural response of savages to their betters."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He could not have suspected, as he was annointed bythe Taks, that he was destined to be the sacrificial harbinger of the Taks ultimate destruction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Perhapsit was only towards the end that he realised that his arrival and the apocalyptic eruption of Krakatoahad always been coincident in Tak folklore: their tribal stories said that the Fiery End would be theheralded by the arrival of the white Katak  Mad Dog Curtis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 27th August 1883."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The fever has melted away the walls between waking and sleep."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Consciousness has become aloathsome fog."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I sense that the incessant rumbling of volcanic activity is connected with thevisions that plague me constantly now ."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thingsancient beyond imagination ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" beyond the ultimate gate of ruin and insanity ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" oceans ofsubterranean fire ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So Curtis final days became a veritable journey into hell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Curtis biography I had with me inIndonesia contained facsimiles of the journal, showing a marked decline in the handwriting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" By theend, the hand was so spidery that one was almost tempted to query the attribution  could this barelylegible scrawl have been produced by the same individual?My head still full of Curtis, I was led into the Vault of Murmurs, the sacred cavern below the Nagotemple in which the Dream Witch receives her supplicants."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Nago sat at the other end of thegrotto, folded into its deep shadows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Feeling a sense of uncanny familiarity, I asked the inevitablequestion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Where was Curtis taken? The Nago nodded, and left, her silence unbroken, in accordancewith custom."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The next morning, I awoke to a feeling of immense anti-climax."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I ransacked my mind for traces of theprevious nights dreams, recalling nothing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Yet through this almost painful disappointment, oldermemories surfaced, dating  I sensed with icy certainty  from my seventh year."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was the night of theCenturys Eve, 31st December, 1899."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" (No Freudian scholar can miss the significance of the year 1899 the date of the first publication of The Interpretation of Dreams."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" )A female voice spoke."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Echidna, Echidna, wake up."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"  I had assumed  previously, if such a timedesignation makes any sense  that this was the voice of my mother."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Now I knew it was the voice ofthe Nago, speaking to me in my own tongue."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But I was no longer sure to whom  or what  it wasaddressed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I was entirely carried away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My body felt impossible."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Touching my face, I encounteredonly the features and limbs of a little girl."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Below the waist, however, all was confusion, snakingendlessly into itself, or rather, into depths beyond sense, traversed by languid spinal waves thatculminated in a distant hint of a tail."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My dream body floated in what appeared to be an undersea cavern."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As I lay there, I beheld, movingtoward me with grim purpose, a raft carrying a solemn, spectral party."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I recognised, from the manybooks recounting the Curtis legend, the crimson markings and ceremonial masks of the Tak NMa."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And on the raft with them  reclining in a malarial swoon, dressed in Tak ritual garb  was theunmistakable figure of Cecil Curtis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They were bringing him to me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Except I was dissolving, becoming indistinguishable from the water which held me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And when Iturned again to where Curtis had been but a moment ago, I heard only anguished gargles: the growlsand snarls of some creature that seemed to be part dog, part cat, barely human."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I felt claws in whatshould have been my side."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Then there was a plume of blood which I at first thought was mine, butwhen I looked again, I saw it gouting from the other creature's flesh, which, I was suddenly aware,was becoming absorbed into me  even as my body was losing any sense of its limits."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Warped perceptions danced past my dream eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Darting acceleration and abyssal slowness fused ina wholly unfamiliar time-sense."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I suddenly became aware of the cyclopean edifices of a lostcivilization; though civilization scarcely seemed the word for the alien vistas that swam before me,swarming city-shoals quivering with a wholly inorganic animation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Something told me, a whisper or an intuition  in that dreaming ocean both blended utterly  that thiswas the lost continent of Lemuria, speculated upon by contemporary archaeologists and mystics."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whatwas left of my mammal body flickered out of focus; it felt clumsy  all fingers and thumbs."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As Ilooked down at my hands, they became transluscent, and I saw, inscribed into the impossiblegeometries of the dream caves wall beyond, an arrangement of ten circles, a number of smallercircles, and a series of interconnecting lines."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This was my first encounter with what came to be called the Numogram."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was only later that I wasable to uncover the numeric relations encrypted in its ancient patterns  the dream showed me onlythe shapes and their relations."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" But, even in those early, hallucinatory minutes, as I made my firsthurried transcriptions of the dream-image, I knew that I had in front of me a key that would unlock allthe secrets of my life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A labyrinth had opened up, a labyrinth whose complexities could be containedno more by our supernaturalisms than by our sciences."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was a labyrinth in which my fate  and thatof the NMa, Cecil Curtis, and more cosmic presences  had always been tangled together."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I wasunravelled in this maze of coincidences, and could do nothing but follow its threads forever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" TchattukStories concerning Tchattuk, Stillwell tells us, invariably refer to Tchattuk stealing something fromKatak."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Devotees of Tchattuk insist that it is this act of theft which triggers Kataks journey around thetime-cycle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tchattuk is both she-who-steals and what-is-lost, simultaneously wounding Katak andmaking her what she is."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is easy to see why Tchattuk was held in special reverence by the Tak NMa, and why that reverencehad a peculiarly ambivalent quality."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Tak language had a special word for this admixture of dreadand love: Tukka."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to the Mu NMa and the Dibboma, the Taks would stage bloody ceremonies in honour ofTchattuk."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tak rituals would show Tchattuk swooping from the sky, sometimes to take Katak up into thestars with her, sometimes to take what she had stolen from Katak into the dark regions of the cosmos."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tchattuk is sometimes called the strange-lights, and there are persistent hints of an extraterrestrialorigin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mu sorcerers who follow Tchattuk talk of riding her to the whirlpool beyond."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This ride, however, isanything but an easy journey."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Impairment and even destruction of memory is always a feature of thevoyage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The word Tchattu, common to all three NMa tribes, is used to refer to amnesia and seniledementia; its literal meaning is taken by Tchattuk."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Some of those who specialize in the Tchattuk-ridepride themselves on their inability to remember anything."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The constant connections between Tchattuk and missing time indicate that this is an entity especiallyconnected with calendrics."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Some say that the Taks treated the NMa calendar with the intercalatedextra three days as the full calendar, and the 729-day cycle as a calendar shortened by Tchattuks actof theft."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The most intense Tchattuk feasts, it is said, always took place during these three days."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is noteworthy in this respect that amongst at least one influential faction of the AOE the Neo-Romandate MM is embraced as the signal for apocalyptic time-war, sacrifical excruciation of HumpaTaddum, noospheric planetary transcendence (Omega-switch), and even eschatologicaltransubtantiation of universal reality."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Trained as a cryptographer in the early 1970s, he has spent his lifedecoding ancient scripts, quasibiotic residues, and anomalous mineral patterns (amongst otherthings)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In late Autumn 1998 Ccru met with Professor Barker in his office at MVU."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The followingis an edited transcript of that meeting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tic-Systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cryptography has been my guiding thread, right through."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What is geotraumatics about,even now?  A rigorous practice of decoding."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So I haven't really shifted at all in this respect."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There isa voyage, but a strangely immobile one."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I started out at MIT working in the information sciences  my thesis proposal was quite conservative,involving mostly technical issues to do with noise reduction and signal modulation  but MVU wasjust getting started, and my research was transferred across to them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That led to various contacts, andfrom there to employment with a NASA-related organization that has particular interests connected toSETI activity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" My task was to help toughen-up the theoretical basis of their signals analysis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theywanted to know how to discriminate  in principle  between intelligent communication and complexpattern derived from nonintelligent sources."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To cut a long story short, it became increasingly obviousto me that although they said they were hunting for intelligence, what they were really seeking wasorganization."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The whole program was fundamentally misguided."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Various people had big problemswith the direction of my research, which had basically veered-off the organizational model."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thesocial friction became intolerable and I had to leave, which was messy because of my high-levelsecurity clearance ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Suborganizational pattern is where things really happen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" When you strip-out all the sedimentedredundancy from the side of the investigation itself  the assumption of intentionality, subjectivity,interpretability, structure, etc  what remains are assemblies of functionally interconnectedmicrostimulus, or tic-systems: coincidental information deposits, seismocryptions, suborganicquasireplicators (bacterial circuitries, polypoid diagonalizations, interphase R-Virus, Echo-DNA,ionizing nanopopulations), plus the macromachineries of their suppression, or depotentiation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Prevailing signaletics and information-science are both insufficiently abstract and over-theoretical inthis regard."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They cannot see the machine for the apparatus, or the singularity for the model."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So ticsystems require an approach that is cosmic-abstract  hypermaterialist  and also participative,methods that do not interpret assemblies as concretizations of prior theories, and immanent modelsthat transmute themselves at the level of the signals they process."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tic-systems are entirely intractableto subject/object segregation, or to rigid disciplinary typologies."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is no order of nature, noepistemology or scientific metaposition, and no unique level of intelligence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To advance in this area,which is the cosmos, requires new cultures or  what amounts to the same  new machines."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The problem was: how to quantify disorganized multiplicities? Diagonal, irregular, molecular, andnonmetric quantities require a scale that is itself nonmetric, that escapes overcoding."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Standardprocedures of measurement and classification prove entirely inadequate, since they presuppose rigidconceptual segmentation by quantity and quality (Deleuze-Guattaris twin-pincers of molarity, typeand degree)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Once things are being worked out at the level of tic-assemblies  or flat ticking arrays there are only intensive populations, and measurement has to give way to engineering fusionalmultiplicities: systems that count themselves only in the way they propagate, immanently numberingmultitudes, like nanoplastic quantum swirls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Eventually a machinic solution was provided by theTick-Distributor, but that came later ."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At first there was just the equation, precipitated in what I stillthought to be my own body, virtual tic-density = geotraumatic tension."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Geotraumatics."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I came to Freud relatively late, associating it with Oedipal reductionism, and moregenerally with a psychologistic stance that was simply irrelevant to cryptographic work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Itsimportant to remark here  no doubt well get back to this  that everything productive in signalsanalysis stems from stripping out superfluous prejudices about the source and meaning of complexfunctional patterns."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I took  and still take  the vigorous repudiation of hermeneutics to be the key totheoretical advance in processing sign-systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was Echidna Stillwell who helped me to see Freudfrom the other side."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was a difficult period for me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There had been a lot of painful fall-out from theNasa work."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Psychotherapists were involved, in part attempting to pathologize and discredit myresearch, and in part responding to real stress-related symptoms."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Between the two was a grey zone oftraumatic dysfunction and paranoia involving difficult feedback effects."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Stillwell persuaded me thatthe only way to get through this was to try and make sense of it, and that this was not the same assubmitting to the interpretative mode."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" On the contrary."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud takesa number of crucial initial steps towards mapping the Geocosmic Unconscious as a traumaticmegasystem, with life and thought dynamically quantized in terms of anorganic tension, elasticity, ormachinic plexion."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Deleuze and Guattari ask: Who does the Earth think it is? It's a matter of consistency."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Start with thescientific story, which goes like this: between four point five and four billion years ago  during theHadean epoch  the earth was kept in a state of superheated molten slag, through the conversion ofplanetesimal and meteoritic impacts into temperature increase (kinetic to thermic energy)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" As thesolar-system condensed the rate and magnitude of collisions steadily declined, and the terrestrialsurface cooled, due to the radiation of heat into space, reinforced by the beginnings of the hydrocycle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" During the ensuing  Archaen  epoch the molten core was buried within a crustal shell, producing aninsulated reservoir of primal exogeneous trauma, the geocosmic motor of terrestrial transmutation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" And thats it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That's plutonics, or neoplutonism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Its all there: anorganic memory, plutonic looping ofexternal collisions into interior content, impersonal trauma as drive-mechanism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The descent into thebody of the earth corresponds to a regression through geocosmic time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Trauma is a body."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ultimately  at its pole of maximum disequilibrium  its an iron thing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At MVUthey call it Cthelll: the interior third of terrestrial mass, semifluid metallic ocean, megamolecule, andpressure-cooker beyond imagination."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Its hotter than the surface off the sun down there, three thousandclicks below the crust, and all that thermic energy is sheer impersonal nonsubjective memory of theoutside, running the plate-tectonic machinery of the planet via the conductive and convectivedynamics of silicate magma flux, bathing the whole system in electomagnetic fields as it tidally pulsesto the orbit of the moon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Cthelll is the terrestrial inner nightmare, nocturnal ocean, Xanadu: theanorganic metal-body trauma-howl of the earth, cross-hatched by intensities, traversed by thermicwaves and currents, deranged particles, ionic strippings and gluttings, gravitational deep-sensitivitiestransduced into nonlocal electromesh, and feeding vulcanism ."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Fast forward seismology and you hear the earth scream."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Geotrauma is an ongoing process, whosetension is continually expressed  partially frozen  in biological organization."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For instance, thepeculiarly locked-up lifeforms we tend to see as typical  those more-or-less obedient to Darwinianselection mechanics  are less than six hundred million years old."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They began with the planetaryoxygenization crisis, triggered by the saturation of crustal iron, followed by mass oxygen-poisoning ofthe prokaryotic biosystem and the emergence of a eukaryotic regime."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Eukaryotic cells are highlysuppressive."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They implement a nuclear command-control model based on genomic ROM, affined tomeiosis-mitosis diplocapture, hierarchical organization, and multicellular specialization."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even thedistinction between ontogeny and phylogeny  distinct time-orders of the individual and the species makes little sense without eukaryotic nuclear read-only programming and immunological identity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Evolutionism presupposes specific geotraumatic outcomes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To take a more recent example, the efflorescence of mammalian life occurs in the wake of the K/TMissile, which combined with massive magma-plume activity in the Indian Ocean to shut-down theMesozoic Era, sixty-five million years ago."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Irruptive vulcanism plus extraterrestrial impact, linked bycoincidence, or plutonic looping."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So there is a catastrophic transition to a post-saurian megafaunaregime, part of a much larger overall reorganization of terrestrial symptomaticity, providing an indexof neohadean resurgence."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Spinal-Catastrophism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For humans there is the particular crisis of bipedal erect posture to beprocessed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I was increasingly aware that all my real problems were modalities of back-pain, orphylogenetic spinal injury, which took me back to the calamitous consequences of the precambrianexplosion, roughly five hundred million years ago."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The ensuing period is incrementally body-mappedby metazoan organization."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Obviously there are discrete quasi-coherent neuromotor tic-flux patterns,whose incrementally rigidified stages are swimming, crawling, and (bipedal) walking."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" ElaineMorgan persuasively traces the origin of protohuman bipedalism to certain deleterious plate-tectonicshifts."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The model is bioseismic."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Crustal convulsions and animal body-plan are rigorouslyinterconnected, and the entire Aquatic Ape Theory constitutes an exemplary geotraumatic analysis."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Erect posture and perpendicularization of the skull is a frozen calamity, associated with a long list ofpathological consequences, amongst which should be included most of the human psychoneuroses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Numerous trends in contemporary culture attest to an attempted recovery of the icthyophidian- orflexomotile-spine: horizontal and impulsive rather than vertical and stress-bearing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The issue here  as always  is real and effective regression."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is not a matter of representationalpsychology."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Consider Haeckel's widely discredited Recapitulation Thesis, the claim that ontogenyrecapitulates phylogeny."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is a theory compromised by its organicism, but its wholesale rejection wasan overreaction."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Ballards response is more productive and balanced, treating DNA as a transorganicmemory-bank and the spine as a fossil record, without rigid onto-phylogenic correspondence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Themapping of spinal-levels onto neuronic time is supple, episodic, and diagonalizing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It concernsplexion between blocks of machinic transition, not strict isomorphic  or stratic redundancy between scales of chronological order."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Mammal DNA contains latent fish-code (amongst many otherthings)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Palate-Tectonics."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Due to erect posture the head has been twisted around, shattering vertebroperceptual linearity and setting-up the phylogenetic preconditions for the face."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This right-angledpneumatic-oral arrangement produces the vocal-apparatus as a crash-site, in which thoracic impulsescollide with the roof of the mouth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The bipedal head becomes a virtual speech-impediment, a subcranial pneumatic pile-up, discharged as linguo-gestural development and cephalization take-off."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Burroughs suggests that the protohuman ape was dragged through its body to expire upon its tongue."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Its a twin-axial system, howls and clicks, reciprocally articulated as a vowel-consonant phoneticpalette, rigidly intersegmented to repress staccato-hiss continuous variation and its attendantbecomings-animal."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thats why stammerings, stutterings, vocal tics, extralingual phonetics, andelectrodigital voice synthesis are so laden with biopolitical intensity  they threaten to bypass theanthropostructural head-smash that establishes our identity with logos, escaping in the direction ofnumbers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Barker Numbering."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Once numbers are no longer overcoded, and thus released from their metricfunction, they are freed for other things, and tend to become diagrammatic."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" From the beginning of mytic-systems work the most consistent problems have concerned intensive sequences."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Sequence is notorder."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Order already supposes a doubling, a level of redundancy: the sequenced sequence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A decodedsequence is something else, a sheer numeracy prior to any insertion into chronologic structure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thatswhy decoding number implies an escape from assumptions of progressive time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Tick multitudesarrive in convergent waves, without subordination to chronology, history, or linear causation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theyproceed by infolding, involution, or implex."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Its a matter of convergence, and numbers do that, oncetheyre free to."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So the first stage required plexive introgression of the tic-density scale, which wasnumerically rigorized as digital twinning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Treat the decimal numerals as a set of 9-sum twins zygonovize  and they map an abstract intensive wave, indifferent to magnitude."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" The pattern really came together with the Diplozygotic Spiral, which arrivedsuddenly, by chance."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" I was playing a game of Decadence, which I had first encountered many yearsbefore."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This game already interested me because of its numerical elegance, its complex associations,and its dependence upon a principle of decimal twinning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It had always seemed to hint at a lostsyzygetic arithmetism, related to the bilateral symmetry of the human body."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Digits are fingers, and theycome in decimal packages of two times five."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In Decadence five makes ten by doubling, or pairingwith itself, scoring zero."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This tantalized me, but I couldn't fit it together theoretically."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The quandarywas unlocked on this occasion, when one of the participants casually mentioned the existence of anocculted variation of the game, called Subdecadence, based on a system of nine-sum twinning."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Subdecadence introduces zeroes, and nine-zero twins."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It works by zygonovic numerism."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" That wasstunning enough in itself, but seeing the two together  or seeing between them  was an incrediblemoment of diagrammatic assemblage."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Since the early 1980s Sarkon had been working on autocatalytic AI systems and swarm robotics atMIT."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" He had been gradually drawn into the outer-orbit of the MVU-types, hypertalented youngspecial projects researchers with no public face."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" By the turn of the millennium 700million years of biological evolution had been recapitulated in 70 years of technical development,leading to AI-programs running at about one thousand MIPs, approximately equivalent to thebrainpower of a guppy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" AI prospects are indistinguishable from the extrapolated dynamics of the electronics industry, whoseexemplary technocapitalist trends involve positive nonlinearities, increasing returns, or runawaytrajectories."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These dynamics predictably exceed such regular exponentials as the doubling-periodsdescribed by Moore's Law, which themselves undergo compressions, or supplementary contractions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to Moravec, Computer power for a given price doubled each year in the 1990s, afterdoubling every 18 months in the 1980s, and every two years before that with further contraction oftime-scales [anticipated] in the coming decades."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whilst ubiquitous, these real trend curves prove intractable to mathematical models presupposing ametric time-dimension, necessitating sporadic arbitrary rectifications."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Extensive accelerationsdescribed by positive exponentials, or doubling-periods are unable to capture intensivecompressions, in which time itself mutates through negative exponentials of time-halving trends."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Beyond the domain of extensive speeds and relative velocities lie the occult zones of true timecompression, in which the future of intelligence crosslinks with changes in the intensive nature oftime."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 2."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Time SimulationMoravec defends the fundamental postulate of AI research, it's Idea of the mind: apprehending humanintelligence as a computable function, equivalent in all important respects to a virtual algorithm, orpossible computer program."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Zig-zagging between practical robotics and science-fiction, Moravec develops an elaborate projectfor the human colonization of the technosphere, a planned obsolescence of the organic body, and ofthe senses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The core of this Moravec-mythos is Uploading."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" You are transported to the technosurgical interface, something like an operating room, where robotsurgeons wait to convert your subjective identity into a computer-compatible format."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Your skull isanaesthetized, but your brain remains awake."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" An evacuation of the flesh."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Without even noticing you have discovered what it feelslike to be a robot."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Already lurking in the near future is an evolutionary leap: a genetic take-over by computerprograms, involving a phase-transition in the chronogenetic efficiency of matter, with consequentcomplete subsumption of the ethosphere into cyberspace."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At the limit of this technomystical delirium it seems overwhelmingly probable that present humanreality is already installed in the memory or simulated past of a future artificial intelligence machine-maya."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is in this context that Moravec arrives at a peculiarly arbitrary ethical maxim: pretend its the firsttime."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The question is: Why play this perverse game, when its almost certainly the second time, atleast, and technological progress is already an artificial memory? AI development shorts-out intolateral xenocommunication."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 3."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Time-IntegrationMoravec describes intelligence as the diagonal line that knits processing power with storagecapacity, precariously occupying the intersection between two time lines: speed and memory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Theratio of megabytes to MIPS  memory over speed  defines a crucial time constant, correspondingto the duration required for a computer to run once through its memory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" This duration is equivalent tothe cognitive integration period  or CIP  for any intelligent system, whether biological,technological, or arcane."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" For humans, Moravec calculates a CIP of approximately one second: One hundred terabytes ofsynaptic storage divided by one hundred million MIPS-equivalent of neural processing power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A onesecond CIP constitutes an anthropically ideal value applicable to everything from simple mechanicaldevice to divinities."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whatever strays from this Goldilocks diagonal seems either too fast or tooslow: Alien and intractable."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It takes at least a second to be human."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Calendric units come to be measured in seconds, rather thandividing into them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" What divides in modernity is not the year but the second."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The international unit of frequency counts in splittings of the second, or Hertz."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Time folds into itselfthrough the second with trans-exponential improvement in metric exactitude, disassembled throughsuccessive cubic decimations into micro-, nano-, and pico-magnitudes, which describe thecomponents of frequencies measured in mega-, giga-, and tera-hertz."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" In its purely arithmetic aspect the second is an ancient Mesopotamian relic, deriving its Latinate namefrom secunda minuta, the second sexigesimal operation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Sumero-Babylonian sexigesimal numeracy supported a chronogeometric system, in which an Ideal360 day model of the year was mapped onto the 360 degrees of the zodiacal circle."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Modern clocktime and geometry still count in this way, subdividing hours and geometric degrees into minutes andseconds."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Three-thousand six-hundred seconds per hour."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to Zecharia Sitchin this figuremicromaps the thirty-six hundred year astrocycle of the Sumerian Annunaki."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Georges Ifrah suggests that sexigesimal arithmetic  produced through modular alternation beween tenand six  can be derived from the finger-counting practices of ancient sumeria."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" One thumbsequentially runs through the twelve segments or phalanxes of four fingers, whilst the five digits ofthe other hand record each group of twelve, to a total of sixty."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Three times four times five."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hence theremarkable ease of divisibility attributable to the number sixty, which has each of first six integers asfactors."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Apparently, the object was time consistency."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Various methods were suggested, often with a surgicalcomponent."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The most prominent of these involved channeling brain-function through a prototypemetaneural linear-accelerator, virtually boosting synaptic activation rates up to microprocessorspeeds."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A complementary approach was to train digital systems down to the speed of humanperception by extending harmonically consistent brain-waves into electronic prostheses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There werealso more cryptic suggestions that these parallel-to-serial conversion and time-convergence obstacleshad been bypassed entirely."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Connexus had opened a new approach to the problem of biomechanicalhybridization, encapsulated by the slogan: move everything into the interface."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Neuroelectronics is already here."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Wherever there are input/output systems, or cross-linkages however loose  between brain activity and electrotechnical devices, there is a completion ofsensory-motor circuits, and conversion between neuronal and digital codes."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Part-8PandemoniumThe system."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Pandemonium is the complete system of Lemurian demonism and time sorcery."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It consists of two principal components: Numogram (time-map) and Matrix (listing the names,numbers and attributes of the demons)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The system is constructed according to immanent criteria latent in decimal numeracy, and involvesonly basic arithmetical operations (assembled from additions and subtractions)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Numogram, or Decimal Labyrinth, is composed of ten zones (numbered 0-9) and theirinterconnections."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These zones are grouped into five pairs (syzygies) by nine-sum twinning[zygonovism]."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The arithmetical difference of each syzygy defines a current (or connection to a tractorzone)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Currents constitute the primary flows of the numogram."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each zone number when digitally cumulated defines the value of a gate, whose reduction sets thecourse of a corresponding channel."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Channels constitute the secondary flows, time-holes, or secretinterconnections of the numogram."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The arrangement of currents divides the Maze into three basic time-systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Firstly, the currents ofthe three central syzygies mutually compose a cycle, rotating in anticlockwise steps."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Lemurian sorcerycalls this inner loop the Time-Circuit."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Secondly, and thirdly, in both the Upper and the Lower syzygiesthe currents produced fold back into (a half of) themselves, constituting autonomous loops: the Warp(upper), and Plex (lower)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Warp and Plex circuitries are of an intrinsically cryptic nature, which iscompounded by the enigmas of their interconnection."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They are variously considered to be Outside- orOuter-time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The gates and their channels knit the Maze together, providing connections between otherwiseincompatible time-systems."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" They open and close the ways of sorcerous traffic."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Although each gatederanges time in its own way, their operations vary with a certain regional consistency."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In addition to the twins (with their currents and time-systems), and the gates (with their channels andtime-faults), there is a third occult thread running through Lemurian time-sorcery: that of the distances(or of the demons)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Between any pair of zones, however seemingly disconnected or unconnectablethey may seem, there is an irreducible (or hyper-) distance, which Lemurian culture systematicallycharacterizes as a singular entity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These entities are simultaneously gaps, links, holes, and demons,with particular traits, features, aspects, and potentials."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each demon is considered to be intrinsically zygonomous (or double-numbered): both addressed by aunique zone-net couple of descending value (net-span), and also called by a mesh-serial, which isimmanently defined by a sequential matrix (00-44)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each demon also has a tonality or pitch, rangingfrom the highest frequency (Ana -7) to the lowest (Cth-7)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" All syzygetic demons have a neutral (orNull) pitch."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Since they are proliferated by a digital cumulation to the ninth power, the demons are forty-five innumber, attuning them to the Gate-City of the Plex-channel - Utterminus of Cthelll - (Gt-45), which isidentified with the microcosmic lair of all demonic populations (the Lemurian Pandemonium)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" According to Lemurian demonism, each demon is itself a swarm, or singular coalescence, but also acomponent of a larger array, which can be sorted by type."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The three principle demonic groupings areChronodemons (varieties of distance within the time-circuit), Amphidemons (ruptures in the timecircuit, openings to the Outside), and Xenodemons (denizens of the outer gulfs)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Demons are also grouped by phase (defined by initial net-span digit)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Each phase is opened by adoor, to which is attributed a domain, a planetary affinity, and a spinal level."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Demons can be characterized by the various rites (routes, or routines) that they draw through thehyper-time of the maze."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is a rite for each way in which the net-span of a demon can beintegrated in extension (or traced across the flows of the numogram)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Such rites are the basiccomponents of demon traffic, constituting modules of practical culture, each of which is associatedwith an omen, and a power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" In Western hyperfictional lore the matrix of all demons (Pandemonium) is called Necronomicon, TheBook of Dead Names, listing all that is excepted from the white-magic book of life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Necronomicon isa document copied episodically from versions of an original text, which was itself retrodeposited outof the future into the deep past."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" In contradistinction to the late-Babylonian(or Judeo-Christian) qabbala, the method of Mu involves a rigorous collapse of transcendentsymbolism into intrinsic or immanent features, excavating the latent consistency between thenumerical figures, their arithmetic functions, and their cultural associations."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" Vysparov seems to have been convinced that these six offspring of Chronos  three of each sex could be rigorously allotted zonal houses on the Numogram Time-Circuit, consistent with thePythagorean gendering of numbers."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" If he ultimately succeeded in establishing these co-ordinations hisresults do not seem to have reached us."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Vysparov also emphasized that this founding myth is one of time disintegration, not time persistence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The Domain of Chronos is a burial complex, ordering the world through the death of integral time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whether beginning from Kants identification of time with the content of arithmetic, or Einsteinsdefinition of time as a (fourth) dimension, attempts to model time seem to necessarily call upon thenumber line."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The most elementary  and notationally efficient  chronometric and calendric systemscount time by addition of unit periods, from caesium atom half-lives through clock ticks to daycounting and annual date-changing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Whatever the scale, the procedure remains the same: theapparently basic arithmetical operation of additive succession, +1, +1, +1, Of course, mathematicians have known for well over two millennia that the number line in no waycompels such an assumption."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Step-by-step additive progression by units is merely one arithmeticallyarbitrary mode of numerical accumulation."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" The cunning mathematician replied: Your majesty, perhaps if you were toplace a grain of rice on the first square, two on the second, and continuing thus, doubling the numberon each successive square until reaching the final [64th] one, it would at least spare me from thedanger of starvation on my return journey."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" It was in this way the kingdom passed for the first time into the hands of strangers This tale, attributed variously to Indian, Chinese and Persian sources, with minor variations in eachcase, is now to be found mostly in schoolrooms, where it is used as an aid in the teaching of binaryexponentiation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The topics it raises, whether concerning mathematics, games and power, number andtrickery, numerical isomorphy between the chess board and the I Ching, or other matters, exceed thescope of this discussion."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Two points will suffice for now:1) The utter obscurity attending the origins of this tale provides highly suggestive support forStillwells ethnomic hypothesis, with its argument that numerical potentiality is capable ofgenerating spontaneous unlocalizable cultural syndromes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 2) Binary exponentiation has a mythic dimension, now largely supplanted in modern societies byMoores Law of techonomic development."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" A privileging of binary exponentiation rather than unit addition is entirely consistent with theprominence of the number line as a model of time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The basic time unit, however, is now conceivedas the doubling period."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"  This approach integrates an intriguing diversity of problematics:1) The I Ching, where time progresses through doubling and bino-decimal cyclicity."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" There is nothingexclusively modern about the extravagant power of time as an exponentially accumulative trend modernity lies rather in the evasion of disaccumulation crisis, which in the time of the I Ching isdescribed as an inevitability of periodic catastrophe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" 2) The Numogram Hex, rigorously echoing the I Ching, although with certain supplementarycomplexities (exceeding the scope of this discussion)."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" We only need to ask: Why does Kether, the first Sephira, occupy the crown of the Tree, unless bymerit of a banal ordinal mechanism  no more than an instinctive reflex  binding primacy tosupremacy and unity? Why does the zig-zag path of divine manifestation continue from Chokmah (2)to Binah (3) and then onwards in tedious ordinal conformity to the end of the series? Is the mere orderof the decimal numerals already a map of creation? If so, why the contrivance of a two-dimensionalarrangement at all? Why not simply say: the great hermetic truth of the scared qabalah is thecapability to count to ten and call it Gods work? And then why is Malkuth (10) entitled to sephiroticstanding at all, unless as a proto-decimal atavism (attesting to an inability even to count to ten withunderstanding) whose numerical incoherence is available for subsequent exploitation as amiraculous symbol of cyclic re-unification (an unwitting tautology gaudily clothed in the pretence ofcosmic significance)? As to the patent absurdity of Daath (11), a Sephira which would be simplylaughable if not encrusted by bejewelled extravagances of magickal solemnity  at this point evenelementary arithmetical competence has been sacrificed without reserve to the mysteries ofinscrutable tradition."}

Of course, there are 22paths, for the overwhelmingly persuasive reason that there are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Let us also leave aside the fact that 22 is a number without any compelling numerical interest, exceptas a tautological reverberation of tradition (being the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet  andof course a doubling of Daath ), and merely ask: what principle organizes their distribution?Except, of course, that there is no such principle, but only tradition, blind authority and  concretely a slithering downwards, vaguely echoing that so gloriously exhibited by the Sephirot themselves."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" (PBS link)]Dear Sir;I am troubling you with this letter both to elicit information and to express certain concerns."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Hopefully, it will be evident that it is written with the very greatest respect, from one long schooledin the arcane sciences to another."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Having carefully studied your popular childrens television show Teletubbies for many years, I amconfident I have gained a basic mastery of its essential content."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Please forgive me if I suggest thisunderstanding was acquired with greater ease than is altogether healthy, or compatible withappropriate hermetic prudence on your part."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" To be frank, the teletubbies wear their occult pedigree ontheir furry jumpsuits  their direct derivation from the five diplodemons of Sumatran time sorcerybeing starkly apparent to any but the most vegetative ignoramus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Thus, the obvious question arises: what happened to the fifth Teletubby?Please understand that I am not questioning the necessity of this excision."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It goes without saying thatthe supervisory authorities (of which, I trust, no more need be said) would have demanded it, if anelementary instinct for self-preservation had not already done so."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Only a lunatic would fight for theright to spread Pentazygonic Lemurianism among the worlds infants."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" So my uttermost discretion can,of course, be assumed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Nevertheless, my question remains."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" While theories and speculations on the topic of the missing fifthare abundant in the relevant literature (where Noonoo, the Baby Sun, even the infant viewer havebeen proposed) these can all, in my humble opinion, be dismissed as groundless."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" The missing fifthmust for obvious reasons of arcane science be of the same Suprageneric type as its four Similarchons,with appropriate discriminative name, height, intonation, colour-coding, antenna-form and magicalweapon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" At the risk of self-contradiction, I must now append my warning to this request."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" While frustrated bythe inaccessibility of the information specified above, I am also alarmed by the denuded hermeticismcharacterizing your show."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Although we initiates of the arcane circle have long-understood that thefuture of religion on this planet approximates far more closely to the Teletubbies than to any existingorganized faith, is it entirely wise to pronounce this truth so baldly to an ill-educated public? Suchthings have been occulted for a reason, I am sure you would agree."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Was it really necessary, for example, to so exactly portray the hideous ecstasies of the Tzog-Murtharitual? A glistening vortex activates and the beings moan Uh oh, their eyes droop with bliss andthey fall on their backs in technocosmic delirium."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" After the big hug (is no blasphemy to be hiddenfrom the worlds toddlers?) they clamber up a hill and stand in the loose spectral formation, theirantennae illuminated by the transmission and their belly monitors sparking with static from the OuterSpheres, as they await the Chosen One."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" It is rare indeed for even the most determined investigatorsinto this abominable rite to have witnessed it unflinchingly portrayed in such comprehensive andgraphic detail."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Even those entirely innocent of the Tzog-Murtha cults cannot but be struck by the sorcerousinclinations of the show, with its incantations and manifestation of objects through songs."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Moreprovocative still is the Baby Sun who mocks God the Father, Logos and the universe of adult authoritywith its inarticulate burblings and chaotic mirth."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" These incautious references are given a further ominous twist by the blatant Lemuro-Cybergothicdimension of the teletubby mechanoverse."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Those the Chinese insightfully translate as the Antennababies (Tianxian Baobao) are the fully cyborgian inhabitants of a futuristic underground bunkerwhose parents have been replaced by an semi-intelligent autonomous vacuuming unit calledNoonoo, combined with a complex subterrestrial acoustic apparatus."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":" Their highly-synthetic diet,produced entirely by machines, consists exclusively of tubby custard and tubby toast a reiteratedaffront to the very idea of organic nourishment."}

{"prompt":"", "completion":" DouglasFrushlee entitled The Tubby Minions of Satan."}
